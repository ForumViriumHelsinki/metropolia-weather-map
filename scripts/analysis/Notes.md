# Analysis

## Notes

Sensors stored until 27/5/24

- Remove from dataset

daylightHours.csv

- Data on 2/6 and 26/5 filled with the previous day's data

## To analyze

- Daily difference between sensors in shade and sun during day

## Possible research questions

- How do temperatures measured by sensors in the shade and in the sun differ?
    - Comparison between temperature measurements from shaded and sun sensors.
- Is there a correlation between temperature and humidity at different measurement points?
    - Investigate how temperature affects humidity at different points on the street.
- How do different times of the day affect temperature and humidity measurements?
    - Time series analysis based on measurements taken at different times of the day.
- Can the temperature and humidity data be used to predict effects after tree felling?
    - Simulation analysis to estimate temperature increases if shaded sensors are exposed to more sunlight after tree felling.
- Are there statistically significant differences in temperature between locations?
    - Spatial analysis: comparing the relationship between sensor locations and temperatures.
